description: Install and configure LiXiPlugin on your server
---

This guide will walk you through installing and setting up LiXiPlugin on your Paper or Folia Minecraft server.

## Prerequisites

Before installing LiXiPlugin, ensure you have:

- **Paper 1.21+** or **Folia** server
- **Java 21** or higher
- **Vault** plugin installed
- An **economy plugin** (e.g., EssentialsX, CMI, etc.)

:::tip[Optional Dependencies]
For physical envelope items, you'll need one of these custom item plugins:
- **ItemsAdder**
- **Oraxen**
- **Nexo**

The plugin works without these, but you won't be able to create physical envelopes.

## Installation

### Step 1: Download

Download the latest `LiXiPlugin.jar` from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/SimpMC-Studio/LiXiPlugin/releases) page.

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

1. **Vault** - Download from [SpigotMC](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/vault.34315/)
2. Place `Vault.jar` in your `plugins/` folder
3. Install an economy plugin if you don't have one already

### Step 3: Install LiXiPlugin

1. Place `LiXiPlugin.jar` in your server's `plugins/` folder
2. Restart your server (or use a plugin manager to load it)

---

## First Run

When you start your server for the first time with LiXiPlugin installed:

1. The plugin will create a `LiXiPlugin/` folder in your plugins directory
2. Two configuration files will be generated:
   - `main-config.yml` - Main plugin settings
   - `message-config.yml` - All player-facing messages

### Default Configuration

By default, the plugin uses:
- **SQLite database** (stored in `LiXiPlugin/database.db`)
- **Vietnamese messages** (fully customizable)
- **No custom envelope item** (you need to set this up manually)

---

## Database Setup

### Using SQLite (Recommended for Small Servers)

SQLite is the default and requires no additional setup. The database file is automatically created at `plugins/LiXiPlugin/database.db`.

### Using MariaDB (Recommended for Large Servers)

For better performance on large servers or networks, switch to MariaDB:

1. Open `main-config.yml`
2. Find the `database` section:

```yaml
database:
  type: MARIADB
  host: localhost
  port: 3306
  database: lixi
  username: root
  password: your_password_here
```

3. Create the database:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE lixi CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
```

4. Reload the plugin: `/lixiadmin reload`

The plugin will automatically create all required tables.

---

## Setting Up Envelope Items

If you want to use physical envelope items, you'll need to configure a custom item:

1. Install **ItemsAdder**, **Oraxen**, or **Nexo**
2. Create a custom item in that plugin (e.g., a red envelope)
3. **Hold the item in your hand**
4. Run `/lixiadmin setitem`

The plugin will automatically detect which plugin you're using and save the item ID to the config.

See the [Setting Envelope Item](/guides/set-item/) guide for detailed instructions.

---

## Customizing Messages

All messages are in `message-config.yml`. You can customize:

- Message text (supports [MiniMessage](https://docs.advntr.dev/minimessage/format.html) formatting)
- Colors and gradients
- Placeholders

Example:

```yaml
chat-lixi-claim-success: "<prefix><green>You received</green> <gold>%amount%</gold><green>!</green>"
```

After editing, reload with `/lixiadmin reload`.

---

## Verification

To verify everything is working:

1. Join your server
2. Run `/lixi` - You should see a list of available commands
3. Try creating a chat broadcast: `/lixi chat 1000 5`
4. Check the console for any errors

If you see errors about economy, make sure Vault and your economy plugin are properly installed.
